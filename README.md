# Visual Exploration of NC Small Claims Filing Fees
## using the [Processing][proc] language

This was a personal project I developed in the Fall of 2011, both as a means to learn Processing and data visualization, and as an effort to produce original research on access to justice for the poor (an interest of mine at the time).

The data was primarily sourced from:

1. NC General Statutes, 1985 - 2010, for filing fees in the 3 court levels

2. NC Administrative Office of the Courts, for the number and type of filings in each county

Using Processing, and a lot of help from Ben Fry's excellent "Visualizing Data," I created several bar and line graphs to present the data in different ways.

This repo contains all the graphs, Processing source code, and data. Feel free to explore and make use of the results in any way you see fit.
